# SEx - Sample Explorer [![Rust](https://github.com/IohannRabeson/SEx/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/IohannRabeson/SEx/actions/workflows/rust.yml)
This is a toy file explorer dedicated to audio samples. You click a sound file, it is played and his waveform is displayed.
It should work on Windows and MacOS, and may work on Linux (I never really tested it).
